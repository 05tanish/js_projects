# 🧠 JavaScript Projects – Beginner to Pro

Welcome to my `js_projects` repository! This is a personal collection of **mini JavaScript projects** that I'm building to sharpen my skills as a Full stack developer . Each project focuses on **core JavaScript fundamentals**, DOM manipulation, events, and interactivity.
